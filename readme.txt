The plugin Stilus for WordPress enables you to get a check report of your contents in Spanish before publishing them in your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Stilus for WordPress enables you to proofread the spelling and the style of your texts in Spanish before publishing them on your WordPress website.

Stilus is not a conventional checker that performs superficial analyses of text. Its large lexical base and context-sensitive proofreading enable to identify real errors with a high level of accuracy, at all linguistic levels: spelling, typography, grammar, and style. Moreover, Stilus for WordPress does not replace words automatically, but detects and revises possible errors offering alternatives and providing didactic explanations supported by references. This way, the user decides whether to edit the text and will never lose the control over the proofreading process.

To enjoy the proofreading service, go to [www.mystilus.com](http://www.mystilus.com/) and click on Register/Access in the upper right corner of the page. After creating your account (be sure to validate it through the email you'll receive), you will be able to use the plugin for WordPress by introducing the same credentials (email and password) you would use on the website.

Fully customizable. Stilus for WordPress makes it possible to configure at any time the proofreading options according to your linguistic or thematic preferences, Spanish variant, or style guide. Click on Settings in the left column of the aministration screen and select Stilus to configure the proofreading options.

To preserve the confidentiality of the texts checked with Stilus, they are automatically deleted once their processing is completed. The only information we store is the one needed to record service consumption: user, time of the request, word count.
